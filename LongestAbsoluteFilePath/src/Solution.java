// If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext". Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.
//
//Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is "dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.
//
//Given a string input representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.
import java.util.Deque;
import java.util.LinkedList;


// Goal: Find all paths for files. Compare their lengths and return the longest one.
// Stack:
// Use a stack to store each path segment. The number of items in stack is the depth of file path
// Split the input string by "\n" first
// Iterate the array of paths, for each path, split by "\t" again to find how deep it is
// While the stack is deeper, pop it until it the same depth as the cur path
// Calculate the current length by adding the current path's length, plus 1 since '\' + path counts
// Update the final result if current path is a file path
// Return the final max length
